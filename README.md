## About the Project

Job Finder API scrapes job postings from multiple platforms such as LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Rozee.pk, Indeed, and Google Jobs.  
It intelligently applies AI-based filtering using LangChain + Gemini to prioritize the most relevant jobs based on user search queries.

This project is:
- Fully asynchronous
- Supports automatic fallback scraping
- Includes robust error handling and retries
- AI-enhanced job matching with detailed relevance scores

## Core Logic Details

### Scraping Workflow

- Firstly, Try to fetch jobs results via official API if it fails than move to scrapping.
- Each job platform has a dedicated scraper implementing `BaseScraper`.
- Scrapers perform asynchronous scraping via `asyncio` and `httpx`.
- In case of failures due to captchas, rate limits, or structural changes:
  - Primary Attempt: Use the standard scraper for the platform.
  - Fallback 1: Switch to mobile version scraping.
  - Fallback 2: Utilize the HasData Web Scraping API as a last resort.

This multi-tiered approach ensures maximum uptime and data retrieval reliability.

### Retry Strategy

- Each HTTP request is retried up to 3 times with randomized delays if it fails.
- Different User-Agent headers are rotated for each request.
- Failing one scraper does not stop the global job search.

## AI Relevance Matching (Deep Dive)

- LangChain is used to orchestrate prompts sent to Google Gemini models.
- The AI model scores each job between 0-100 based on:
  - Exact match of Job Nature (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite)
  - Similarity of Position Title
  - Skill matching
  - Experience level comparison
  - Location proximity

Each job result includes:
- Relevance Score (float between 0.0 and 1.0)
- Relevance Percentage (0% - 100%)
- Short AI explanation why the job scored that relevance

## Prompt Engineering

- Candidate requirements and job details are inserted into a carefully designed prompt.
- The AI then returns:
  - `SCORE`: 0-100
  - `EXPLANATION`: Why this score is appropriate

- If Gemini API fails, a fallback rule-based scoring system based on keyword matching is used instead.

## Fallback and Error Handling

| Problem Area        | Handling Strategy                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Scraper fails        | Skip, log error, continue others     |
| Request Timeout      | Retry with exponential backoff       |
| API Key Missing      | Fallback to rule-based scoring       |
| AI Model Call Failure| Fallback to rule-based scoring       |

## Important Notice

This project implements a **hybrid retrieval logic**:  
- **First**, it attempts to fetch job listings using **official APIs** if available.  
- **If API retrieval fails** (due to API errors, unavailability, or restrictions), it **falls back to web scraping** methods to ensure robustness and maximum data coverage.

### ðŸ“„ API Access Status per Platform:

| Platform    | Official API Availability | Access Method                             | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Indeed      | Deprecated / Third-party   | Using third-party APIs (e.g., HasData)    | Official Indeed API is not available for new developers.             |
| Rozee.pk    | No Public API               | Contact Rozee.pk for partnership         | No public access; only private/internal APIs are available.          |
| Glassdoor   | Deprecated                  | Contact Glassdoor for business partnership | Public Glassdoor API has been discontinued for general developers. |

### ðŸ“¢ Current Implementation Details:

- API connection attempts have been made where possible (e.g., HasData for Indeed).
- However, **several official APIs are either deprecated or require private partnerships**, which are currently pending or unavailable.
- **LinkedIn scraping is successfully implemented** and retrieves job postings reliably.
- For platforms like **Indeed**, **Glassdoor**, and **Rozee.pk**, multiple scraping techniques were attempted (including handling Cloudflare and bot protections).  
  Despite all optimization efforts, **heavy anti-bot mechanisms** prevented consistent scraping without official access or enterprise proxies.
- Therefore, **fallback scrapers** are provided, but **may have limited results** until official API keys are approved.

### ðŸ”¥ In Summary:

- **LinkedIn search** is fully functional.
- **Other platforms** are under **API approval waiting** or require **enterprise partnerships**.
- As soon as access is granted, the system can **seamlessly auto-update** without major changes.
